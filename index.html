<h2>We believe that sharing is killing the open web.</h2>

<p>
   That might seem like a bold statement (and it is), but as the 1% of
   social media sites continue to dominate our lives, we inch closer
   to a web that is closed off and controlled by large, billion dollar
   corporations. No amount
   of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_evil">"don't
   be evil"</a> can protect us.
</p>
<p>
   We've seen these sites go from an open sharing model (when they
   were smaller, and lesser known) to a model defined by personalized
   recommendation algorithms, a practice known
   as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble">filter
   bubbling</a>. Want to ensure that your 2 year old's picture shows
   up in her grandmother's feed? You can't.
</p>

<h2>The plumbing for an open web already exists.</h2>

<p>
   Since the late 90s, authors on the Internet have been able to share
   their work in an open, standardized way that is simple for computer
   programs to understand and extract meaning from. We believe that
   these technologies are <em>mandatory</em> for an open web (yet, the
   top 1% of social media sites have <em>eliminated</em> them from
   their feature sets). There are two such formats in common use: <a href="http://www.rssboard.org/">RSS</a>
   and <a href="http://atomenabled.org/">Atom</a>. "Common use" isn't good enough. RSS and Atom should be <em>the</em> plumbing in use whenever possible, on the open web.
</p>
<p>
   There are still sharing focused services that utilize and support
   RSS and Atom as plumbing.
</p>
<p>
   Many sharing focused services still support this plumbing. We
   encourage you to utilize those instead of publishing your content
   into a black hole. In addition, we encourage you to publish
   2 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML">OPML</a> files at
   the root of your website, /reading.xml, and /publishing.xml. Like
   <a href="http://robotstxt.org">robots.txt</a>
   or <a href="http://slashpurpose.org">/purpose</a>, the predictable
   location is key, so that we can ensure future tools can
   automatically discover them.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>What goes into /reading.xml?</strong> /reading.xml is an OPML file that
  outlines all of the feeds that you consume in your feed reader. Some feeds contain
  authentication, either because they are customized from a service, or because they
  are hosting paid content of some sort. These feeds should <em>not</em> be published
  in /reading.xml.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>What goes into /publishing.xml?</strong> /publishing.xml is an OPML file
  outline all of the feeds (Atom/RSS) that <em>you</em>, or your organization are responsible
  for.
</p>
<p>
   We believe that openness about these things will help us build
   better and more interesting ways to share and consume shared content
   in the future, and ultimately protect the open web from closing up.
